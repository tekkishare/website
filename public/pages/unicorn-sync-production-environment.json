You have deployed your code and Sitecore items on Staging/Production environment and released it to client/content author for content entry. So content author is doing content entry regularly and developers are doing their development as well. After sometime developers deployed the code and Sitecore item and ran unicorn sync. What will happen?</p><p>It would over write the staging/Production content.</p><p>What is the resolution of this issue?</p>",

In this way, your existing item(s) will not be over write. When you run unicorn sync, it would sync only new items. It will not do anything for the existing items.</p>",
