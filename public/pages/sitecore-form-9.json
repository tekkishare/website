Sitecore providing Form out of the box with Sitecore 9.0 installation.</p><p>Sitecore tried to make Forms very simple. In my opinion, they tried hard to make our developers life simple specially in terms of designing forms. Its user interface is very much similar to Visual Studio IDE where you get toolbar. You just need to drag control from the toolbar and need to drop it on your form.</p>",
